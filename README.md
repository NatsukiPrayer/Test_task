# Test_task
In this task I've had three timelines:
1) Tutor appearance on the online-lesson
2) Pupil appearance on the online-lesson
3) Lesson time
The point of this task is to find intersections between all these timeline
The main problem was that you have no guarantie pupil doesn't open 
more than link with online-lesson, causing some timelines inside the same timeline
On the entry I have three dictionaries with times of ever timeline start and end
On the output I need to give correct amount of intersection time
